						<h3>Why Programming</h3><br>
						<p>Well it all began when I was still in varsity, I needed a website for my side business cause I wanted a better online presence where I could display my products, thus I went out and looked for someone who could help me build my site. I managed to find someone but realised I could not afford to pay him so I decided to learn how to build one on my own. After many many hours, weeks and months of messing around and learning, I started to enjoy coding. The idea of typing out something, giving it some instructions and then watching it work and move gave me an exhilarating feeling. The idea that I can create anything and everything like chatting apps with node.js, to virtual worlds that move and interact with C# and Unity all the way to the ability to basically automate my entire life was an idea that just excited me. Coding truly gives us the power to create the solutions we need. That is actually the whole point of technology; To solve the problems in our lives or environment. </p>
